Cryptography
------------

1) Confidentiality - restricting access of information

2) Integrity - verifying that information has not been altered (accidentally or maliciously)

3) Authentication - verifying the identity of a party

Good Cryptography
-----------------

Depends on 3 things:

1) Hard Math Problems. If you can solve that math problem, you can break the cryptography.

2) Correct implementation of the algorithms

3) Key Secrecy - Secret piece of info (key) used to uncover information is kept secret from adversaries

Attackers will try to either: Solve the math problem, take advantage of an issue with the implementation, or try to obtain the key

Public-Key Cryptography
-----------------------

Different from Symmetric Cryptography

Symmetric: Encrypt AND Decrypt using the secret key

Public-Key: Encrypt with public key and decrypt with private key

Encrypting files is usually symmetric. But how do you use a single key when multiple parties want to look at the same information? -> Need Public Key Crypto

PKC used whenever 2 or more parties need to communicate securely. Parties dont have to be be people; can be servers, browsers, API endpoints... Examples: HTTPS, Firewalls, Routers, Printers, SSH, Cryptocurrencies

HTTP is not encrypted

Quantum Computing
-----------------

New form of computation based off of Quantum Physics

Harnesses Quantum Properties like Entanglement, Superposition, and Interference to solve problems in a completely new way. For some types of problems, quantum computers can solve them much faster than classical computers can

One of these problems is factoring. Shor's Algorithm - quantum algorithm. RSA depends on the hardness of factoring: Shor's breaks it with a powerful enough quantum computer.
